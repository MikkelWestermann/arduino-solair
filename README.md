Project developet in relation to the 34338 course at DTU. Our idea for the project was to develop a climate control system for an apartment using a blackbox placed on the
outside of the appartment which would be heated by sun and then a monitoring system capable of moving the air into the appartment.

The repo contains two different script where main is the one that is reponsible for the main part of the logic and is to be run on the ESP8266 that is inside the blackbox
other script is responsible for the indoor component running on the ESP8266 with the LCD screen.

please refer to the repport for futher details about the setup.
